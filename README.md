# Portfolio
Homework assignment number 2 


In this Assignment I and made a basic portfolio and incorporate most of the elements that we have covered in the course so far. I attempted to do a few things that didn't work out and I was unable to find a solution for, I left the incorrect code in the source taken out with comments. I was unable to really make it look pretty so I ran with a very basic comical color and format as to make the different elements clearly visable.
